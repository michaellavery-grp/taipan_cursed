**Title**: [Project] Taipan! (1982) - Faithful iOS Port with Storm System | Classic Apple II Trading Game Reborn

---

**Body**:

Remember **Taipan!** from the Apple II days? The 1982 trading game where you sailed the South China Sea, dodged pirates, and built your merchant empire?

I've been working on a faithful iOS port, and just released **v1.0.3** with the storm system fully implemented! 🌊⛈️

## 🎮 What is Taipan?

For those who never played the original: You're a merchant captain in the 1860s South China Sea. Buy opium cheap in Hong Kong, sell it high in Manila. Manage your fleet, battle pirates, juggle debts with Elder Brother Wu, and try to become a millionaire Taipan.

It was one of those games you'd boot up in computer class and play until the teacher caught you. 😄

## 📱 The iOS Version

This port stays true to the 1982 original while adapting to modern iOS:

**What's Authentic**:
- ✅ Original combat formulas (escape, damage, booty calculations)
- ✅ Seven ports (Hong Kong, Shanghai, Manila, Bangkok, Singapore, Rangoon, Saigon)
- ✅ Four commodities with the exact same price ranges
- ✅ Multi-port debt system (10% monthly interest compounds FAST!)
- ✅ Banking in Hong Kong only (just like the original)
- ✅ Dynamic ship pricing based on armament
- ✅ **NEW in v1.0.3**: Storm system! (10% chance, ship sinking, blown off course)

**Modern Improvements**:
- SwiftUI native interface (no terminal required!)
- Touch controls instead of keyboard menu navigation
- Save/load your empire (JSON format)
- Opium price tracker across all ports
- Real-time seaworthiness display

## ⛈️ What's New in v1.0.3

**Storm System**:
- 10% chance per voyage (matches original mechanics)
- Ship damage reduces seaworthiness
- At 80%+ damage, risk losing ships to storms
- Can lose 1-N ships, or even your entire fleet (game over!)
- 33% chance of being blown off course to random port
- Dramatic storm alerts with damage reports

**Combat Rebalance**:
- Pirates now scale with YOUR fleet size (like the original!)
- Small fleet (1 ship): 1-8 pirates
- Large fleet (10 ships): 100+ pirates!
- Makes combat feel appropriate at every stage of the game

## 🛠️ For Developers

The codebase is open and welcoming contributions! Written in Swift/SwiftUI.

**Still to implement** (from the original):
- Li Yuen the Pirate Lord encounters
- Cash robberies and bodyguard massacres
- Elder Brother Wu emergency loans
- Time-based warehouse spoilage
- Bank interest accrual

**Want to help?** The project needs developers to:
- Add more ports (Canton, Macao, Osaka)
- Implement remaining original features
- Add sound effects / music
- Create historical event system
- Port to other platforms?

## 📱 How to Install

Since it's open source, you can install it free on your iPhone using Xcode (no $99/year developer account needed!):

1. Install Xcode (free from Mac App Store)
2. Clone the repo
3. Open `TaipanCursed.xcodeproj`
4. Connect your iPhone
5. Hit Build & Run

Full instructions in the README with screenshots.

The parent project is a Perl terminal version with even MORE features (animated pirate ship splash screen using Lottie→ASCII conversion, it's wild).

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Taipan! was one of the formative trading games that inspired everything from Pirates! to Port Royale. It deserves to be playable on modern devices without emulation.

Plus, it's a great example of how well 1982 game design holds up. The risk/reward balance, the economic simulation, the combat - it's all still FUN 43 years later.

## 💬 Discussion

Who else remembers Taipan? Did you play the original on Apple II, or one of the many ports (C64, Amiga, etc.)?

What other classic trading games would you like to see revived?

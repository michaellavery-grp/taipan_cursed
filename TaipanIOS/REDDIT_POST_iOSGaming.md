- **Battling** pirates (fight, run, or throw cargo to escape)
- **Banking** in Hong Kong (deposit for interest, borrow for leverage)

Goal: Build a ¥1,000,000 net worth and become a legendary Taipan (富豪 - tycoon)!

## 💬 Questions?

**Q: Why not on App Store?**
A: Keeping it open source and free. App Store requires $99/year + compliance overhead. Xcode install takes 30 min once, then you have it forever.

**Q: iPad support?**
A: Works on iPad but UI isn't optimized yet. Looking for contributors!

**Q: Multiplayer?**
A: Not planned, but open to PRs! Could be cool with async leaderboards.

**Q: Is it hard?**
A: Fair but brutal. You WILL lose your first empire to debt/pirates/storms. That's part of the fun!

**Q: How accurate is the history?**
A: Extremely! Opium trade, port locations, British/Spanish colonial presence, Taiping Rebellion era (1850s-1860s). It's basically a playable history lesson.

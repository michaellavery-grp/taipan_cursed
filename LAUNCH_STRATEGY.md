Title: [OC] I recreated the 1979 Taipan trading game as a modern terminal app (Perl + Curses)

Hey r/linux!

I just released Taipan Cursed - a faithful recreation of the classic 1979 BASIC trading game, rebuilt for modern terminals using Perl and Curses::UI.

What makes this special:

🎮 GAMEPLAY
- Trade opium, silk, arms, and general goods across 7 historical treaty ports
- Real-time "hot prices" tracker showing best buy/sell opportunities
- Naval combat system - command multiple ships against pirates
- Multi-port warehouse network (10,000 capacity per city)
- Face Li Yuen, the legendary pirate lord

⚡ TECH HIGHLIGHTS
- Pure Perl 5 with Curses::UI
- Beautiful ASCII map art of the South China Sea
- Runs in ANY terminal (xterm, tmux, screen, you name it)
- Save/load system with JSON
- No dependencies beyond core Perl modules + Curses

🎯 WHY I BUILT THIS
The original Taipan taught me programming as a kid on an Apple II. I wanted to preserve that experience while making it accessible to modern terminal users. It's also a love letter to the era when games fit in 8KB of RAM.

📦 INSTALL & PLAY
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaellavery-grp/taipan_cursed
cd taipan_cursed
perl Taipan_2020_v1.1.0.pl
```

Perfect for:
- Long SSH sessions
- tmux gaming breaks
- Teaching game development concepts
- Nostalgia trips

The code is clean, well-commented, and demonstrates practical Perl patterns. Pull requests welcome!

Would love feedback from the community. What other classic terminal games should get the modern treatment?

Title: Taipan: A 1979 trading game rebuilt in modern Perl with Curses::UI - shows Perl is still fun!

Hey Perl folks!

I just released a project that might interest you - a complete recreation of the 1979 classic Taipan trading game using Perl 5 and Curses::UI.

Code highlights:
- Clean OOP patterns with package globals and data structures
- Curses::UI for TUI with multiple windows/widgets
- JSON-based save system
- Hash-based state management for game world
- Random event generation with weighted probabilities
- Real-time price tracking algorithm

The game has:
- 2,500+ lines of well-documented Perl
- Multi-port trading simulation
- Naval combat mechanics
- Dynamic pricing system with "hot deals" tracker
- ASCII art rendering

This shows that Perl is still excellent for:
✅ Rapid game prototyping
✅ Complex data structure manipulation
✅ Terminal UI applications
✅ State machine implementation

It's also a great learning resource for intermediate Perl developers wanting to see practical patterns in action.

Would love your code review and suggestions!

### Hacker News Post
```
Title: Taipan (1979) trading game recreated in Perl with Curses

I rebuilt the classic 1979 Taipan trading game for modern terminals using Perl and Curses::UI.

For those unfamiliar: Taipan was an influential early trading/strategy game where you commanded merchant ships in 1800s China, trading opium and silk while battling pirates. It inspired games like Elite and Sid Meier's Pirates!

This recreation features:
- Faithful gameplay with modern enhancements (multi-port warehouses, fleet combat)
- Real-time price comparison system across all trading ports
- Pure terminal UI - runs anywhere with Perl + Curses
- Save/load system
- ~2,500 lines of clean, documented Perl

The original fit in 8KB on the Apple II. This version prioritizes code clarity while keeping the terminal-only spirit alive.

Interesting technical bits:
- Curses::UI event handling for responsive TUI
- Port-based price generation with volatility modeling
- State persistence with JSON
- ASCII map rendering of historical South China Sea routes

GitHub: https://github.com/michaellavery-grp/taipan_cursed

Happy to discuss the implementation or trading strategy!

🎮 From 1979 BASIC to Modern Perl: A Game Development Journey

I just open-sourced Taipan Cursed - a terminal-based recreation of the classic 1979 Taipan trading game.

Why this matters for developers:

1️⃣ Legacy Code Modernization
Translated 8KB of Apple II BASIC into 2,500 lines of maintainable Perl while preserving original game mechanics.

2️⃣ Terminal UI Design
Demonstrates modern Curses::UI patterns for building responsive text-based interfaces - relevant for DevOps tools, monitoring dashboards, and SSH applications.

3️⃣ State Management
Implements clean patterns for game state, event systems, and data persistence that apply to any stateful application.

4️⃣ Open Source Learning
Fully documented codebase serves as a practical tutorial for:
- Perl development patterns
- TUI application architecture
- Game logic implementation
- Random event generation

The game itself is fun too - trade opium across 7 historical ports, battle pirates, and manage a merchant fleet!

Perfect weekend project to explore terminal programming or introduce younger developers to classic computing.

### r/retrogaming
**Title:** I rebuilt the influential 1979 Taipan trading game - the game that inspired Elite and Sid Meier's Pirates!

**Body:**
```
Taipan (1979) was one of the most influential early computer games - it established the "trading and combat" genre that later inspired Elite, Sid Meier's Pirates!, and countless others.

I just released Taipan Cursed - a faithful recreation for modern terminals.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
The original ran on the Apple II in 8KB. You played a merchant in 1849 China during the Opium Wars, trading between treaty ports while battling pirates. It taught a generation about risk/reward, market dynamics, and resource management.

MODERN VERSION:
✅ Faithful to original gameplay
✅ Enhanced with multi-ship combat
✅ Real-time price comparison system
✅ Multiple warehouse locations
✅ Runs in any terminal

WHY TERMINAL?
Keeps the spirit of the text-based original while leveraging modern Curses UI for better visuals. No GPU bloat - just pure strategy.

PLAY NOW:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaellavery-grp/taipan_cursed
cd taipan_cursed
perl Taipan_2020_v1.1.0.pl
```

For anyone who remembers the original: yes, Li Yuen is still a menace.

### r/programming
**Title:** Taipan: Reverse-engineering a 1979 BASIC game into modern Perl + Curses

**Body:**
```
Interesting exercise in legacy code translation: took the 1979 Taipan trading game (8KB of Apple II BASIC) and rebuilt it in modern Perl with Curses::UI.

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES:
- Translating random number seed patterns from BASIC
- Implementing Curses event loop vs GOTO-based flow
- State persistence (JSON) vs no saves in original
- Price generation algorithms from vintage code

ENHANCEMENTS ADDED:
- Real-time price tracking across all ports (new algorithm)
- Multi-window TUI with live updates
- Extended combat system with fleet management
- Port-based warehouse network

CODE STATS:
- 2,500 lines of Perl
- Hash-based game state
- Event-driven UI updates
- Weighted random events

Interesting study in:
- How games were optimized for 8KB
- BASIC → Modern language patterns
- Terminal UI design
- Game state management

Code is MIT licensed and well-documented if you want to study the patterns.

https://github.com/michaellavery-grp/taipan_cursed

Happy to discuss the implementation details!
```

### r/gamedev

## 🎮 DEV.TO / HASHNODE

**Title:** I Rebuilt a 1979 Trading Game in Perl - Here's What I Learned

**Tags:** #perl #gamedev #terminal #opensource

**Body:**
```markdown
# Why Rebuild a 45-Year-Old Game?

Taipan (1979) was the game that taught me programming. Playing it on an Apple II, I was fascinated by how 8KB of BASIC could create such an engaging trading simulation.

Fast forward to 2025: I decided to recreate it for modern terminals using Perl and Curses::UI.

## What is Taipan?

Taipan is a trading and combat game set in 1849 China during the Opium Wars. You command merchant ships, trade goods (opium, silk, arms) across treaty ports, battle pirates, and try to become wealthy.

It inspired later classics like Elite and Sid Meier's Pirates!

## The Build

**Tech Stack:**
- Perl 5
- Curses::UI for terminal interface
- JSON for save/load
- ~2,500 lines of code

**Key Features:**
- 7 historical trading ports
- Real-time price tracking (my addition!)
- Multi-ship combat system
- Warehouse network
- Random events (storms, pirates, deals)
- ASCII map art

## Technical Challenges

### 1. BASIC → Perl Translation

The original used GOTO statements and single-letter variables. I had to:
- Map BASIC's control flow to structured Perl
- Understand the original random number generation
- Preserve game balance while modernizing

### 2. Curses::UI Event Loop

Unlike BASIC's sequential INPUT statements, Curses requires event-driven programming:

```perl
$text_entry->set_binding(sub {
    my $input = shift->get();
    handle_command($input);
}, "\n");
```

### 3. Real-Time Price Tracking

I added a "hot deals" system that compares prices across all ports:

```perl
sub update_hot_deals {
    my @opium_prices;
    foreach my $port (@ports) {
        push @opium_prices, {
            port => $port,
            price => $port_prices{$port}{opium}
        };
    }
    @opium_prices = sort { $b->{price} <=> $a->{price} } @opium_prices;
    # Split into high/low categories...
}
```

This gives players actionable intelligence - "Buy low in Manila, sell high in Shanghai!"

### 4. State Management

Implemented clean save/load:

```perl
sub save_game {
    my $filename = "${firm_name}_${date}.dat";
    open my $fh, '>:utf8', $filename;
    print $fh encode_json(\%player);
    close $fh;
}
```

## What I Learned

### 1. **Perl is Still Fantastic**
Modern Perl with proper structure is clean and powerful. Perfect for rapid development.

### 2. **Terminal UIs Are Underrated**
Curses lets you build sophisticated interfaces with minimal resources. Great for:
- SSH tools
- Monitoring dashboards
- DevOps utilities
- Games!

### 3. **Game Design is Timeless**
The core gameplay loop of Taipan (trade → profit → upgrade → explore) still works perfectly 45 years later.

### 4. **8KB Was Impressive**
The original devs were wizards. Every byte mattered. Modern devs can learn from their efficiency.

### 5. **Documentation Matters**
I over-commented the code intentionally. Future maintainers (including future me) will thank me.

## Try It Yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaellavery-grp/taipan_cursed
cd taipan_cursed
perl Taipan_2020_v1.1.0.pl
```

## What's Next?

Ideas for future versions:
- Multiplayer over TCP
- Additional ports and goods
- More historical events
- Sound effects (terminal beep artistry!)
- High score server

## Conclusion

Rebuilding Taipan was a journey through computing history, a Perl refresher, and a fun game development project all in one.

If you remember the original, give it a try! If you're new to it, experience what gaming was like when imagination filled in the graphics.
